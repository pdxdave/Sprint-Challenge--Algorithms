#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n)
I'm sure my read on this is pretty simplistic, but it strikes me as linear. It seems that
no matter what value is put in for 'n', the time to run it it will be proportionate to that.

b) 0(n^3)
Hmmm...sort of up in the air on this one.  When I see for loops I think of 0(n), and here we have
four of them.  Could it be 0(n^4)?  The last for loop though (e.g., for 'l') seems linear because
it has k+1 and 10+k.  Whatever is plugged into 'k' wil keep this consistent.  If so, I think it makes
that loop 0(1). My gut is telling me it's probably 0(n^3).  Or maybe I'm just feeling nauseous.

c) 0(n)
I will go with 0(n) on this one.  The complexity will be proportionate to whatever is plugged into bunnies,
and I don't mean Eveready bunnies.
